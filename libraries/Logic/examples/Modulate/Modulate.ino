| Configurable Custom Logic library                                     |
| Developed in 2019 by MCUdude.      https://github.com/MCUdude/        |
| Example by Spence Konde.
|                                                                       |
| Modulate.ino - replicating the "timer modulation" feature             |
|                                                                       |
| In this example we use the configurable logic peripherals of the of a |
| modern AVR to achieve the "modulate one timer's PWN with another's"   |
| behavior like some of the more full-featured classic megaAVR parts    |
| We set one input to TCA0 WO1, the other to TCB1 WO, and mask the third|
| and set the truth table so that the output is only HIGH when both are |
| HIGH. You can add some third condition as well, if that was somehow   |
| useful too!                                                           |
| As can be immediately seen, this is vastly more powerful than what the|
| classic AVRs were capable of, where this could be done only with two  |
| timers on a single pin. Now any CCL output pin can be used be made to |
| output any timer channel, modulated by any other. We could even use   |
| the CCL as an event generator to move the output to one of the EVOUT  |
| pins!                                                                 |
| On the Dx-series and 1-series parts, one of the TCD channels might be |
| used, which may be the most useful thing to modulate with another     |
| timer, with the higher maximum speed and dithering features.          |
